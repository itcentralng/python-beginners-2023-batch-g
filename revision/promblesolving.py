# Q1. Create a program to manage a library's book lending system

# - We are creating a library lending system for iT Central
# - Add librarian:- name, id
# - Add books - name, author, id, copies, genre
# - Add students:- name, id, class, passport
# - Store books borrowed:- book, student, date borrowed, return date
# - Update borrowed books on return - add returned date

# Usage:
# - Librarian logs in to the system - with name and id
# - Librarian adds books - with name, author, id, copies, genre
# - Librarian adds students - with name, id, class, passport
#  - A student picks a book and comes to the librarian:
#           - Librarian enters - book, student, date borrowed, return date
#           - system deducts from the copies of that book
# - Student returns book borrowed
# - Librarian updates borrowed book

# Q2. Create a program to manage admission process in iT Central
