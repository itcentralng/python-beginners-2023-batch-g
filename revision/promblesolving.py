# Usage:
# - Librarian logs in to the system - with name and id
# - Librarian adds books - with name, author, id, copies, genre
# - Librarian adds students - with name, id, class, passport
#  - A student picks a book and comes to the librarian:
#           - Librarian enters - book, student, date borrowed, return date
#           - system deducts from the copies of that book
# - Student returns book borrowed
# - Librarian updates borrowed book
