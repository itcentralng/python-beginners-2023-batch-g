# Q1. Write a function that takes 3 numbers and prints the first number
# as it's, the second number multiplied by 3 and the third number raised

# Q2. Write a function that takes a list of 6 numbers and return
# all the even numbers in a new list 
# e.g. yourfunction([1,2,3,4,5,6]) => [2, 4, 6]

# Q3. Write a function that takes a string of alphabets and prints out
# all the vowels found in the string without repetition.
# e.g. yourfunction('mystring is here') => 'ie'

#Q4. Write a function that takes a list of dictionaries and returns
# an ordered list of dictionaries where the dictionary with the highest score
# comes first while the one with the lowest score comes last.
# e.g. mylist = [{'score':20, 'name':'Ibrahim'}, {'score':40, 'name':'Sani'}]
# yourfunction(mylist) => [{'score':40, 'name':'Sani'}, {'score':20, 'name':'Ibraim'}]
